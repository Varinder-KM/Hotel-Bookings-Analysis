# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis

## Project Overview
Hotel booking analysis involves analyzing data related to hotel bookings to gain insights and make informed decisions.

Some of the key data points that can be analyzed include booking patterns (such as time of year, length of stay, and booking channel), customer demographics (such as age, gender, and location), and customer behavior (such as cancellation rates and on-site spending).

By analyzing this data, hotel managers can make more informed decisions about pricing, marketing strategies, and operational improvements. For example, they may identify patterns in booking behavior that suggest the need to adjust room rates during certain times of year or optimize their online booking process to increase conversion rates.

Overall, hotel booking analysis can help hotels better understand their customers and improve their business operations to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.
